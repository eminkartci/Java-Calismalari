/*
 * Write a method that takes a HashMap<String, Integer>. 
 * The method should identify two integers from the values of the HashMap,
 * where the first one is divisible by the second. 
 * The method must print keys of all such pairs of numbers on console. 
 * Pairs of keys cannot be the same. 
 * Suppose I have the following keys and values in HashMap named hm:
"A":20
"B":120
"C":40
"D":17
"E":51
I should be able to call divisibles(hm) and it should only print out the associated keys as:
B is divisible by A.
B is divisible by C.
E is divisible by D.
